# Music-Playlist-Creation-using-unsupervised-machine-learning
Using Clustering with Means, it was possible to create 21 cohesive Playlists with a dataset of 5000 songs using 11 features.
Firstly, the dataset was fitted using the RobustScaler, which works well for the squewed data distributions of the features.
To reduce the dimensions, a PCA was performed.
The Inertia and Silhouette Scores were ued as metrics to determine a reasonable Clustersize.
